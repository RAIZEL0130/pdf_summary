# Project Name

## Description
This project implements two algorithms to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers: the Euclidean algorithm and the Consecutive Integer algorithm.

## Algorithms
- **Euclidean Algorithm**: This algorithm uses a series of division steps to find the GCD. It is efficient and commonly used.
- **Consecutive Integer Algorithm**: This algorithm iterates through all integers from 1 to the minimum of the two numbers to find the GCD. It is less efficient than the Euclidean algorithm.

## Usage
1. Run the `Comparison.py` file to see the GCD calculation using both algorithms.
2. The output will display the GCD, the number of iterations performed, and the time taken by each algorithm.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (for the GUI)
